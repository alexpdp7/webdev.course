Introduction to HTML
====================

HTML is the markup language used to create web pages that can be displayed in a
web browser. As such, it is the foundation for any web development.

We will use the `Web Platform <http://www.webplatform.org/>`_ as the base of
this section, specifically the following documents:

#. `The Basics of HTML <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/guides/the_basics_of_html>`_
#. `DOCTYPES and markup styles <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/guides/doctypes_and_markup_styles>`_
#. `The HTML \<head\> <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/guides/the_html_head>`_
#. `HTML text <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/guides/html_text>`_
#. `HTML lists <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/guides/html_lists>`_
#. `HTML links <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/guides/html_links>`_
#. `HTML tables <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/guides/html_tables>`_
#. `Images in HTML <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/guides/images_in_html>`_

Objective
---------

You should be able to write simple web pages without much fancyness, we will
focus on pretty things in the :doc:`HTML and CSS <html_and_css>` section.

Tools
-----

We recommend against using very basic text editors such as Windows' Notepad.
Some features that are very useful are:

* Having a tabbed interface which allows us to jump quickly (with keyboard
  shortcuts) from one file to another
* Syntax highlighting for HTML and CSS, which helps us locate syntax errors
  quickly
* Completion for HTML elements and attributes is useful, but not really
  critical
* A filesystem navigator to open related files quickly

Some common, approachable editors with these features are:

* `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_ (available for Windows, OS X and Linux)
* `Sublime Text <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`_ (available for Windows, OS X
  and Linux)
* `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ (available for
  Windows, OS X and Linux)
* `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ (available for Windows)

Of course, `vim <http://www.vim.org/>`_ and
`GNU Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_ are the traditional powerful
editors, which might be daunting for beginners but worth learning as skills
on an advanced editor pay off. IDEs might also be good options, especially:

* `Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/>`_ (available for Windows, OS X
  and Linux)
* `IntelliJ Idea <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`_ or the web specialized
  `WebStorm <https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/>`_ (non-free, limited
  Community edition available, for Windows, OS X and Linux)
* `Visual Studio Community <https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx>`_
  (available for Windows)

IDEs take more time to set up and master, but have advanced programming
language support.

Development process
-------------------

At this stage, having a text editor open on the files you are editing and
simultaneously opening them on a web browser, refreshing as you make changes,
should be enough- although some editors have mechanisms to perform automated
reloading of the browser on changes.

Exercises

Mini wikipedia
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create 3-4 pages describing some item of interest, such as a place, historical
character or artwork. Each item's page should include a descriptive image,
links to the other pages and different sections.
