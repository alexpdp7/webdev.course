webdev.course
=============

This is a complete course in web development; it does not assume any knowledge
about web development although it does require basic programming knowledge.

The course will focus in traditional server-side HTML rendering web development,
as we believe that it is the first thing a beginner should learn, as
single-page-apps are still not suitable for all web development- especially for
the first projects a beginner should attempt.

We will however cover the complete full stack, including simple database
development (using RDBMSs, as most pages have a need of server-side storage
and SQL databases should be the default choice for that).
